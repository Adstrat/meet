# Meet App :pushpin:
This app displays events for different cities that users have selected.

It's a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React using a test-driven
development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch
upcoming events.

## Deployment

Here is the [link to the Meet App](https://adstrat.github.io/meet/) on github-pages.

##  User Stories and Gerkhin Scenarios

### :black_small_square: FEATURE 1: FILTER EVENTS BY CITY

**USER STORY:**
As a user
I should be able to “filter events by city”,
so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.

#### SCENARIO 1: WHEN USER HASN’T SEARCHED FOR A CITY, SHOW UPCOMING EVENTS FROM ALL CITIES.

**Given** the user hasn’t searched for any city

**When** the user opens the app

**Then** the user should see a list of all upcoming events

#### SCENARIO 2: USER SHOULD SEE A LIST OF SUGGESTIONS WHEN THEY SEARCH FOR A CITY.

**Given** the main page is open

**When** user starts typing in the city textbox

**Then** the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed

#### SCENARIO 3: USER CAN SELECT A CITY FROM THE SUGGESTED LIST.

**Given** the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox and the list of suggested cities is showing

**When** the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list

**Then** their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”)
And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city

### :black_small_square: FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS 

**USER STORY:**
As a user
I should be able to “show/hide an events details”,
so that I can only see the list of events I need to at that moment.

#### SCENARIO 1: WHEN A USER HASN’T CHOSEN AN EVENT YET, DON’T SHOW ANY.

**Given** the users hasn’t chosen an event yet

**When** the user first enters the view for a city

**Then** the user should only see event names, but not their details

#### SCENARIO 2: USER SHOULD SEE DETAILS OF EVENTS WHEN THEY HAVE SELECTED ONE.

**Given** the user has chosen an event

**When** the user clicks on an event button

**Then** the user should see details about that event

#### SCENARIO 3: USER NO LONGER WANTS TO SEE DETAILS ABOUT AN EVENT

**Given** the user has decided to finish reading an event

**When** the user clicks on the ‘hide’ button

**Then** the event details should disappear and only see event names, not details


### :black_small_square: FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS 

**USER STORY:**
As a user
I should be able to “automatically see a reasonable amount of events which I can choose to adjust”,
so that I see the optimum number of events that leads to a satisfying user experience.

#### SCENARIO 1: WHEN A USER HASN’T CHOSEN HOW MANY EVENTS, 32 IS THE DEFAULT NUMBER.

**Given** the page for a city is open but the user hasn’t done anything yet

**When** the user chooses a city

**Then** the user will see 32 possible events

#### SCENARIO 2: USER CAN CHANGE THE NUMBER OF EVENTS THEY WANT TO SEE

**Given** the user would like to see more/less events

**When** the user types a new number

**Then** the user should see the same number of events

### :black_small_square: FEATURE 4: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE 

**USER STORY:**
As a user
I should be able to “use the app when offline”,
so that I can have maximum access to the app.

#### SCENARIO 1: SHOW CACHED DATA WHEN THERE’S NO INTERNET CONNECTION

**Given** the user wants to use the app

**When** the user is offline

**Then** the user should be able to see cached data without internet coverage

#### SCENARIO 2: SHOW ERROR WHEN USER CHANGES THE SETTING (CITY, TIME RANGE)

**Given** the user is offline

**When** the user tries to change settings

**Then** the user should see an error message

### :black_small_square: FEATURE 5: DATA VISUALIZATION 

**USER STORY:**
As a user
I should be able to “have visual representations of data (ie charts)”,
so that I can get an instant impression of what’s going on.

#### SCENARIO 1: SHOW A CHART WITH THE NUMBER OF UPCOMING EVENTS IN EACH CITY

**Given** the user hasn’t chosen an event

**When** the user is on the events page for a particular city

**Then** the user will see a chart with the upcoming events in that city
